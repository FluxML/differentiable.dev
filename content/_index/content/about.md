Differentiable Programming (∂P) is a [programming paradigm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differentiable_programming), comparable to functional or object-oriented programming. Like those paradigms, it provides a unified perspective and a set of techniques and patterns for solving computational problems. Unlike them, not every part of a ∂P program is human-designed down to the last detail. Instead, we fine-tune parts of our programs using real-world data, allowing us to solve fuzzy, complex and heuristic real-world problems.

∂P is an [extension](https://www.facebook.com/yann.lecun/posts/10155003011462143) of recent breakthroughs like Deep Neural Networks, which we see as [extending our programming toolkit](https://medium.com/@karpathy/software-2-0-a64152b37c35) rather than replacing it. Combining data-driven learning with human knowledge and ingenuity is a best-of-both approach that can solve previously intractable problems, and this is bringing exciting results in areas as broad as pharmacology, climate science and digital signal processing. This site collects just a few of these examples.
