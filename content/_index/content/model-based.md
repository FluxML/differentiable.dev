Model-based reinforcement learning has advantages over model-agnostic methods, given that an
effective agent must approximate the dynamics of its environment. However, model-based
approaches have been hindered by the inability to incorporate realistic environmental models into
deep learning models. Previous work has had success re-implementing physics engines using machine
learning frameworks, but this effort has a large engineering cost, has limitations compared
to existing engines, and has limited applicability to other domains such as biology or meteorology.
