title="Neural Differential Equations"

Neural latent differential equations incorporate a neural network into the ODE deriva-
tive function. Recent results have shown that many deep learning architectures can be compacted and
generalized through neural ODE descriptions. Latent differential equations have also
seen use in time series extrapolation and model reduction.
